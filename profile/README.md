# Raj Lang

A modern easy to use multipurpose programming language implemented in multiple programming language and can be compiled to many programming languages.

</div>

## Syntax

Raj lang's syntax is primarily inspired form [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>)

```raj
# Function

// Function declaration
fn main() {
  println("Hello World");
}

// Calling
main();

# Variables declaration

// with keyword
let a = "a"; // mutable
const b = "b"; // im-mutable

// without declaration
a = "a"; // mutable
b = "b"; // mutable
```

## :thinking: Why?

When [I](https://github.com/Rajaniraiyn) started programming, I trembled to read or understand any code except HTML. Then I slowly learned CSS and then Python. Then I tried to create a website without using JavaScript, but I couldn't do what's in my mind. So I tried to build client-side static webpages using Python but I failed. One day something come across my mind **Universal Programming Language** - A programming language that can be interpreted or compiled to others. At last _Raj Lang_ was born.

## Implementation

### In Progress

| Languages  |       Lexer        |         Parser          |        Compiler         |
| :--------: | :----------------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: |
| JavaScript | :heavy_check_mark: |   :heavy_check_mark:    |   :man_technologist:    |
|   Python   | :man_technologist: | :building_construction: | :building_construction: |

### Planned
